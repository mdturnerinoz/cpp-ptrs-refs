This sub-project was created from a Geek Stuff blog entry entitled "How to 
Use C++ Reference Variables (C++ Reference Vs Pointer Example)" at 
http://tinyurl.com/mwj9k2w .  

I have just added a make file and added some descriptive prose for the 
purpose of allowing the reader to bould the project and thus understand it 
better (without all the typing :0) ).  

pogo:cpp-ptrs-refs marty [master] $ ls
makefile  pointers*  pointers.cpp  refs*  refs.cpp

I Hope it is helpful in some way.
